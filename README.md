# TagRecommendationEngine
 Efficiently generates and refines article tags by combining YAKE for keyword extraction, SpaCy for entity recognition and part-of-speech tagging, and custom rules. It ensures precise and relevant tagging for improved content organization and discovery.

## Overview
The Tag Recommendation System is designed to extract and generate relevant tags for articles using advanced text processing techniques and natural language processing (NLP). The system leverages multiple libraries and algorithms to ensure accurate and meaningful tags that reflect the content of the articles.

## Features
- **Content Extraction**: Fetch and clean XML content from URLs.
- **Keyword Extraction**: Use YAKE and SpaCy for extracting keywords and named entities.
- **Tag Generation**: Generate and refine tags based on extracted keywords and entities.
- **Tag Filtering**: Apply various filtering techniques to improve tag relevance.
- **Frequency Analysis**: Count and analyze the frequency of tags.
- **Synonym Detection**: Identify and group similar tags using word vectors.
- **Category-specific Rules**: Apply custom rules based on content categories.

## Dependencies
This project requires the following Python libraries:
- `requests`: For making HTTP requests.
- `BeautifulSoup4`: For parsing HTML and XML content.
- `re`: For regular expressions.
- `collections`: For data structures like `defaultdict` and `Counter`.
- `fuzzywuzzy`: For string similarity calculations.
- `rich`: For rich text and table formatting in the console.
- `yake`: For keyword extraction.
- `html`: For handling HTML entities.
- `pandas`: For reading and processing CSV and Excel files.
- `spacy`: For NLP tasks, including POS tagging and named entity recognition.
- `textwrap`: For text formatting.
- `concurrent.futures`: For parallel processing.
- `gensim`: For working with word vectors.

## Installation
Install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 fuzzywuzzy rich yake pandas spacy gensim
python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg
Configuration
Set Up Paths: Update the paths for your CSV, Excel files, and FastText model in the script.

csv_file_path: Path to the CSV file containing existing tags.
excel_file_path: Path to the Excel file with additional tags and article counts.
model_path: Path to the FastText word vectors model.
Run the Script: Execute the script to process XML data and generate tags.

Usage
Run the script with the following command:
bash

python script_name.py

Main Functionality
------------------
Fetch XML Content: Retrieve XML content from the specified URL.
Clean Content: Remove HTML tags and entities from the content.
Extract Keywords: Use YAKE to extract keywords and SpaCy to identify named entities.
Generate Tags: Combine extracted keywords and entities to propose potential tags.
Filter Tags: Refine tags based on their similarity to existing tags and title relevance.
Analyze Tags: Count tag frequencies, apply category-specific rules, and detect synonyms.
Output Results: Print tag frequencies and synonym clusters in a formatted table.

Example
--------
Set the url variable to the desired XML data source and run the script:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    url = "https://rss1.oneindia.com/xml4apps/www.oneindia.com/latest.xml"
    process_xml_data_with_tables(url)

# Functions:
-------------

extract_words_from_weblink(weblink): Extracts and processes words from a URL.
extract_entities(text): Extracts named entities from text using SpaCy.
extract_yake_keywords(text, extractor): Extracts keywords from text using YAKE.
generate_tags(title, keywords_with_scores, entities, existing_tags): Generates potential tags based on the title, keywords, and entities.
filter_keywords_by_title(keywords, title_words, threshold=0.5): Filters keywords based on their similarity to title words.
generate_suggested_tags(yake_keywords, ner_keywords, title_words): Generates suggested tags based on keywords and entities.
merge_similar_tags(tags, threshold=0.8): Merges similar tags and selects the most relevant ones.
extract_ngrams(text, n): Extracts n-grams from text.
get_pos_tags_for_phrases(phrases): Retrieves POS tags for phrases using parallel processing.
filter_ngrams(ngrams, pos_tags): Filters n-grams based on their POS tags.
apply_category_specific_rules(category, tag_frequency, filtered_ngrams): Applies rules based on content category to refine tag frequencies.
detect_synonyms_and_similar_tags(tags, threshold=0.7): Detects and groups synonyms and similar tags using word vectors.
process_xml_data_with_tables(url): Processes XML data to extract and generate tags, and displays results.

Future Improvements
-------------------
Reduce Execution Time: Implement thread pools for parallel processing to decrease execution time.
Minimize Redundancy: Optimize the code to reduce redundant operations.
Machine Learning: Integrate machine learning models to fine-tune tag generation based on data patterns.
API Development: Develop an API to integrate the tag recommendation system with other applications.
